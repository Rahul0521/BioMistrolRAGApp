# Bio Mistrol RAG App

This repository contains the source code for the Bio Mistrol RAG (Random Access Generator) App, designed to facilitate random access generation for bioinformatics applications. The app utilizes Python 3 for the backend logic with FastAPI, and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend interface. Additionally, it incorporates C++ for performance-critical components, Llama for efficient data management, and Qdrant Cloud for high-performance similarity search.

## Features

- **Random Access Generation:** Efficiently generate random access patterns for bioinformatics data.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Utilizes FastAPI for building fast web APIs with Python, ensuring high-performance backend operations.
- **HTML/CSS/JS Frontend:** Incorporates HTML, CSS, and JS for building a responsive and interactive frontend interface.
- **C++ Components:** Incorporates C++ for performance-critical tasks, optimizing computation-intensive operations.
- **Llama Integration:** Leveraging Llama for efficient data management, ensuring fast data access and manipulation.
- **Qdrant Cloud Integration:** Utilizes Qdrant Cloud for high-performance similarity search, enhancing bioinformatics data analysis capabilities.
